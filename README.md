## About
That's term paper on solving System of Linear Algebraic Equations via three methods:
- Gauss method
- Gauss-Jordan method
- Inverse matrix method
This software is aimed to be educational so it allows user to look at each method step-by-step, with explanations.

## Plan
Currently, the main goal of software has come to an end, but I will be continuing polishing it, because I like to try things out.
Hence, here is the roadmap:
- [ ] Write tests for application UI
- [ ] Migrate from workers to Tauri IPC
  - [ ] Reimplement Algorithms to Rust
  - [ ] Reimplement algorithm tests to Rust
  - [ ] Setup interaction via IPC
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] Try to minify application binary (by excluding unnecessary or too big libraries)
